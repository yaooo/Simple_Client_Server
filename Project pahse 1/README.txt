List of .py files that use different hosts:

client.py       ----   local host
RS_server.py    ----   local host
TS_server.py    ----   grep.cs.rutgers.edu

Additional Requirement from the TA
1- if you are working as a group only one member should submit the project and write the other member's name in project description.

2- client and RServer should run in the same computer and TServer should run in grep.cs.rutgers.edu. The client and RServer should not run in the same computer as TServer (e.g., do not use grep.cs.rutgers.edu for them).

3- The file format for Resolved.txt is 'DomainName    IP    FLAG\n' or if there is no IP found use 'Hostname - Error:HOST NOT FOUND\n'. Please do not forget to put an \n after each line.

4- Please do not take any input from the user, hard code port numbers yourself and for IP address you should be able to find the proper IP addresses within the program. Taking input from users make grading tedious and may result to reduction of the points.
